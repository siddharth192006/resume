            <p>Mrs. Coley’s three-flat brick<br>
                Isn’t here any more.<br>
                All done with seeing her fat little form<br>   
                Burst out of the basement door;<br>
                And with seeing her African son-in-law<br>   
                (Rightful heir to the throne)<br>
                With his great white strong cold squares of teeth <br>  
                And his little eyes of stone;<br>
                And with seeing the squat fat daughter,<br>   
                Letting in the men,<br>
                When majesty has gone for the day—<br>
                And letting them out again.</p>
